				A question often asked to survivors: “What were you wearing?”. Usually in a fashion context it means fun and says: “I love the choices that you made.” But when Ms.Nguyen was sexually assaulted and had to answer the question, it was meant to be shameful. “It’s victim blaming — it was meant to say, ‘You incurred the violence against you because of the outfit you were wearing,’” she said.”

				So the show confronts this question head on and “upend the stigma associated with sexual assault”.
