					Amanda Nguen was a Harvard student of Class 2013 who got sexually assaulted in her dormitory. When she reported her rape kit to the law enforcement, she was told the evidence would only be valid for 6 months, after that the rape kit would be destroyed. So she rewrote the law on Sexual Assault survivor rights in the United States.
